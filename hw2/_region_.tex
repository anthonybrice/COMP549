\subsection{Man-Computer Symbiosis, Linklider}

I find it funny that Linklider offhandedly almost predicts the internet with the
line about ``a network of [thinking] centers, connected one another by wide-band
communication lines and to individual users by leased-wire services.'' Like
Vannevar Bush, he doesn't realize that the key to the idea is that the network
be distributed. In his implementation ``users'' make requests to linked ``thinking
centers'' that serve content, but a primary feature of the internet is that each
node is just as capable of either.
